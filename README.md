# pw-word-gen
A Haskell library that generates pronounceable passwords

This is based on Tom Van Vleck's javascript generator @ http://www.multicians.org/thvv/gpw-js.html

You can use this for any reason, provided that you:

 * Let Tom Van Vleck know you are using it: http://www.multicians.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/thvv/squirnet.cgi
 * Share your source freely
 * Give Tom Van Vleck, and all the other pioneers, if you use the data or algorithms. (A link to http://www.multicians.org/thvv/gpw-js.html is sufficient

## Project Goals

* Generate pronounceable passwords
* Generate hard-to-guess passwords: harder than Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
